Time for a Change is a project to give new life to an old alarm clock.

Originally stated in https://smayze.wordpress.com/2015/05/05/time-for-a-change.
The purpose of this project is to provide a facility to learn about micro-controller
interfacing with other components using a practical example. At the same time, SysML
will be used to model the project in an attempt to also learn the application of
SysML.
